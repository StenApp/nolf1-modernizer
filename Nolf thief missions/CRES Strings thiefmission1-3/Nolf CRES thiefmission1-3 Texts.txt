IDS_DIALOGUE_14058      "One more thing. I've heard stories. They say this place is haunted."
IDS_DIALOGUE_14059      "You speak of the Grey Servant."
IDS_DIALOGUE_14060      "The story goes that Sir Alfred Cramble, the Lord of this manor,\nhad been carrying on with a pretty young maid of French descent.\n Lady Cramble, who they say wasn't right in the head to begin with,\ntook it upon herself to end the affair... with an axe.\nOne afternoon, as the poor girl was cleaning the great hall,\nLady Cramble creeps up behind her and whack, off with her head."
IDS_DIALOGUE_14061      "Is the story true?"
IDS_DIALOGUE_14062      "No one knows for sure, but it's believed the girl still roams these halls making sure everything stays spick and span."

IDS_DIALOGUE_14064      "Be that as it may, I'm told that if the Grey Servant sees you picking up trash or straightening a vase, she'll be moved to aid you."
IDS_DIALOGUE_14065      "Hmmm, I'll keep that in mind."
IDS_DIALOGUE_14066      "This place certainly looks haunted."

IDS_DIALOGUE_14069      "What's wrong?"
IDS_DIALOGUE_14070      "Just a bit haggard, I'm afraid. We've been sightseeing nonstop since we arrived."
IDS_DIALOGUE_14071      "That's a pity. I was going to suggest we drive to Aberdeen tomorrow morning.\nThe brochure says you can actually herd sheep yourself."
IDS_DIALOGUE_14072      "Darling, I don't think I'm up to it."
IDS_DIALOGUE_14073      "How about Loch Ness? The travel agency gave me the name of a tour guide\nwho guarantees a sighting of the Loch Ness monster or your money back."
IDS_DIALOGUE_14074      "Really? Well, I suppose we shouldn't pass that up.\nNot that I'm particularly anxious to try monster hunting, mind you. I've had quite enough of ghosts and goblins."
